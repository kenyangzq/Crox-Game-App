## Introduction
This is an iOS board game we developed during the Vandy Hackathon in Fall 2016. The rule is pretty simple: each player plays alternatively till one wins. Player playes by choosing an edge in the board that has not been colored.

The color of a dot indicate the color of its neighboring edges. The winning condition is also pretty clear: Player 1 wins by connecting the top border with the bottom border, and Player 2 wins by connecting the right border with the left border.
